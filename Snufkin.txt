The wise adventurer

Snufkin is a philosopher and a wanderer who enjoys the simple things in life – fishing, playing his harmonica and walking alone at night. 




A free spirit with no interest in owning things, Snufkin enjoys challenging authority figures such as park keepers. 
He greatly values his independence, but returns to Moominvalley every spring to spend time with his good friend Moomintroll. 
Snufkin is widely admired for his quiet confidence and self-belief, especially by the smaller and more timid residents of Moominvalley.

Although others often see him as a rather solitary type, Snufkin can always be relied upon to help others in a fix. (He even once became a temporary foster parent to twenty-four lost little woodies.) Freedom is the most important thing in the world to him, but he cares about the needs of others and takes his responsibilities seriously. He knows that Moomintroll misses him terribly when he goes away, so he always leaves a reassuring letter promising to be back on the first warm day of spring.


“Snufkin feels rather uncomfortable about owning anything at all.”

Snufkin carries the few belongings he needs in his backpack and lives in his tent, which is ‘that green summery colour that makes one think the sun is shining outside’. He pitches it near the Moominhouse all through the summer. Entrance is strictly by invitation only, but often very much hoped for – many creatures are drawn to Snufkin because of his enigmatic but kind nature.
